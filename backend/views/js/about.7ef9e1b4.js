If you find any bugs, problems, or have some ideas about how to make the site more intuitive,<br> please let me know via <link rel="stylesheet" href="mhGearOptimizer@gmail.com">. Any kind of feedback is welcome, really.<br><br> This Website kinda grew out of an idea I had, when I was first learning how to code in 2020,<br> Back then, all there was, was a worse version of the Algorithm that&#39;s on this site now,<br> displaying some results in the console. So this is very much a hobby project. With that in mind, please be patient with updates to this site, as i can&#39;t guarantee that progress will be fast &#39;n steady,<br> but I&#39;d love to keep working on expanding the builder to support further titles of the Monster Hunter Series and features, if there is some interest. <br> For more details on what I&#39;m playing around with atm, have a look at the &quot;roadmap&quot; section further down. Thanks again for stopping by, and have a blast Hunting! <br><br> Sincerely, Dominik </p></div><div class="roadmap"><hr><h2>roadmap</h2><hr><p>Next steps in development are:</p><p>- Adding user registration, so you can save all of your talismans and wishlists</p><p>- Expand the Database, so i can make another builder for Iceborn</p><p>- I would love to add a sidebar to navigate builers for different titles</p><p>- more puns</p></div><div class="toolsUsed"><h2>Tools Used</h2><p>For everyone interested in the Coding process,</p><p>I would also like to give Credit to the Creators of the packages I used:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/dafcoe/vue-collapsible-panel">Vue-Collapsible-Panel by dafcoe</a></li><li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-slider-component">Vue-Slider-Component by NightCatSama</a></li></ul></div>',3);function r(e,t){return i}var s=o(89);const n={},h=(0,s.Z)(n,[["render",r]]);var l=h}}]);
