    <p>Hey there,<br>
     thank you for trying out the Gear Optimizer!<br>
     I hope you can get some use out of this project.
     If you find any bugs, problems, or have some ideas about how to make the site more intuitive,<br>
     please let me know via <link rel="stylesheet" href="mhGearOptimizer@gmail.com">. Any kind of feedback is welcome, really.<br>
    <br>
     This Website kinda grew out of an idea I had, when I was first learning how to code in 2020,<br>
     Back then, all there was, was a worse version of the Algorithm that's on this site now,<br>
     displaying some results in the console. So this is very much a hobby project.
     With that in mind, please be patient with updates to this site, as i can't guarantee that progress will be fast 'n steady,<br>
     but I'd love to keep working on expanding the builder to support further titles of the Monster Hunter Series and features,
     if there is some interest. <br> 
     For more details on what I'm playing around with atm, have a look at the "roadmap" section further down. 
     
     Thanks again for stopping by, and have a blast Hunting! <br><br>
     Sincerely, Dominik

    <p>Next steps in development are:</p>
    <p>- Adding user registration, so you can save all of your talismans and wishlists</p>
    <p>- Expand the Database, so i can make another builder for Iceborn</p>
    <p>- I would love to add a sidebar to navigate builers for different titles</p>
    <p>- more puns</p>
