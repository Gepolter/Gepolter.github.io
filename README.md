# Monster Hunter Build Pawcessor

This Node.js SPA is my playground for exploring webdevelopment, while trying to provide a service to part of the Monster Hunter community.

- [live Demo] (https://mhbuildpawcessor.com/)

## Architecture

- MEVN stack
- VueX for state management
- Raygun for Monitoring
- Hosted on Heroku

## Features

- Heuristic Cobinatorics Algorithm for live-calculation of builds. As the Pawcessor isn't dependent on pre-calculated results, users can provide prioritized, impossible to obtain skill compinations, and the algorithm will provide it's best approximation of gear combinations.
- Dynamic components for displaying finished builds and the configuration of Talismans and a Wishlist to provide the Algorithm with the users desired skills and their corresponding levels
- Guide for first-time users
- About page with Roadmap for future development plans
