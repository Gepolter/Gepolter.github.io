    <p>Hey there,<br>
     thank you for trying out the Gear Optimizer!<br>
     I hope you can get some use out of this project.
     If you find any bugs, problems, or have some ideas about how to make the site more intuitive,<br>
     please let me know via <link rel="stylesheet" href="mhGearOptimizer@gmail.com">. Any kind of feedback is welcome, really.<br>
    <br>
     As all of this is the result of a rather ambitious goal i set for myself, when i started learning how to code in 2020,<br>
     i can't guarantee that progress on this site will be fast 'n steady,<br>
     but I'd love to keep working on expanding the builder to support further titles of the Monster Hunter Series and features,
     if there is some interest. <br> 
     For more details on what I'm playing around with atm, have a look at the "roadmap" section further down. 
     
     Thanks again for stopping by, have a blast Hunting! <br><br>
     sincerely, Dominik
