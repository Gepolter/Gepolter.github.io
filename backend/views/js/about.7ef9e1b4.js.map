Any kind of feedback is welcome, really.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     This Website kinda grew out of an idea I had, when I was first learning how to code in 2020,<br>\r\n     Back then, all there was, was a worse version of the Algorithm that's on this site now,<br>\r\n     displaying some results in the console. So this is very much a hobby project.\r\n     With that in mind, please be patient with updates to this site, as i can't guarantee that progress will be fast 'n steady,<br>\r\n     but I'd love to keep working on expanding the builder to support further titles of the Monster Hunter Series and features,\r\n     if there is some interest. <br> \r\n     For more details on what I'm playing around with atm, have a look at the \"roadmap\" section further down. \r\n     \r\n     Thanks again for stopping by, and have a blast Hunting! <br><br>\r\n     Sincerely, Dominik\r\n     \r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"roadmap\">\r\n    <hr>\r\n    <h2>roadmap</h2>\r\n    <hr>\r\n    <p>Next steps in development are:</p>\r\n    <p>- Adding user registration, so you can save all of your talismans and wishlists</p>\r\n    <p>- Expand the Database, so i can make another builder for Iceborn</p>\r\n    <p>- I would love to add a sidebar to navigate builers for different titles</p>\r\n    <p>- more puns</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"toolsUsed\">\r\n    <h2>Tools Used</h2>\r\n    <p>For everyone interested in the Coding process,</p>\r\n    <p>I would also like to give Credit to the Creators of the packages I used:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><a href=\"https://github.com/dafcoe/vue-collapsible-panel\">Vue-Collapsible-Panel by dafcoe</a></li>\r\n      <li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-slider-component\">Vue-Slider-Component by NightCatSama</a></li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </div>\r\n  \r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n  .about{\r\n    text-align: left;\r\n  }\r\n  .roadmap{\r\n    text-align: left;\r\n  }\r\n  .toolsUsed{\r\n    text-align: left;\r\n  }\r\n  .about > p{\r\n    font-family: sans-serif;\r\n  }\r\n  .roadmap > p{\r\n    font-family: sans-serif;\r\n  }\r\n  .toolsUsed > p{\r\n    font-family: sans-serif;\r\n  }\r\n  .toolsUsed > ul{\r\n    font-family: sans-serif;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n\r\n</style>\r\n","import { render } from \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=template&id=35511162\"\nconst script = {}\n\nimport \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=35511162&lang=css\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Dominik\\\\vs-workspace\\\\mhGoApp\\\\mh-go-front\\\\node_modules\\\\vue-loader\\\\dist\\\\exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["_hoisted_1","script","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
